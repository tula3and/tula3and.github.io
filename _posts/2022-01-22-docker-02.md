Using a Docker image, you can build a Docker container.
Then how can I make the image?

## Docker images are from containers

Like each container from an image, a Docker image is also from a container so
it is essential to define how a container works on `Dockerfile`.

```dockerfile
FROM baseImage

RUN command

CMD ["executable", "parameter"]
```

A sample structure of `Dockerfile` looks like this.
First, choose `baseImage`. A Docker image is consist of many layers and the basement of them is called `baseImage`.
It is similar to a kind of OS in a certain image.
Second, run several commands. They contain additional installation, adding layers above the `baseImage`.
(It is called layer caching.)
The final line is a start command.
You will run a container based on the contructed image and the start command will be executed.

The image below is steps after executing `docker build ./`.

Dockerfile check a `baseImage` first and make a temporary container.
The Docker server puts a snapshot and a start command in the container and make a target image.
If the image is created, the container is deleted.

## Make a Dockerfile to execute a python script

I make a very simple python script file `test.py` and a Dockerfile to execute it.

```dockerfile
FROM python:latest

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY test.py ./

CMD ["python", "test.py"]
```

There is two new commands: `WORKDIR` is to set a working directory
and `COPY` is to copy a local file to a container.
Setting the working directory first is important because the default position is on root.
There is a danger of overwriting and a managing inconvenience while running commands on root.
Copying files is also necessary to use local files in a container.
Containers cannot reach resources outside of them.

Make a Docker image with `docker build ./` and run a container with `docker run <IMAGE ID>`.
There is `hello world!` at the bottom. Now you can make a Docker image to build your own environment!

Plus, for your convenience, you can give a certain name for the image: `docker build -t <username>/<repository>/<project>:<version> ./`.
