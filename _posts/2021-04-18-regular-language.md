Learn about regular languages first and identify regularity of the languages.<br/>

## What is regular languages?

A regular language (also called a rational language) is a formal language that can be defined by a regular expression.
Then, what is the regular expression (REGEX)? It uses a given alphabet (Î£), arithmetic expressions (+, â€¢, *), and
primitive regular expressions (Ã˜, Î»). If `r1` and `r2` are regular expressions (REXs), `r1 + r2`, `r1 â€¢ r2`, and `r1*` are also regular ones.
- Every regular language `L(r)` has a REGEX `r`.
- Every REGEX `r` has a regular language `L(r)`.

REXs have NFA (or DFA). Conversion proceeds with a generalized transition graph (GTG).
- Every REGEX can build NFA (or DFA).
- NFA (or DFA) can make REXs.

A GTG must be a complete one which all edges are present, so
missing edges should be defined as undefined (Ã˜).
From every GTG with more than two states, we can also find an arbitary GTG: a GTG with only two states.
The remains are the initial state and a final state.<br/>

In [the previous post](https://tula3and.github.io/computer%20science/automata/),
I mentioned that languages' definition is a little bit ambiguous itself so it needs grammars.
A regular language also has a regular grammar.
Regular grammars must be right or left linear and they can make NFA (or DFA).

In conclusion:
1. A regular language are empty, finite, or infinite.
2. Every empty and finite one is regular. (They can make NFA (or DFA).)
3. REXs â‡” NFA (or DFA) â‡” Regular grammars

### Example: find a REGEX for language L

L = {w âˆˆ {0, 1}*: w has no pair of consecutive zeros}

```
r = (1 + 01)*(0 + Î»)
```

The image below is an automaton M(r) accepts L((1 + 01)*(0 + Î»)).

## Find non-regular languages: pumping lemma

Regular languages are empty, finite, or infinite, but not all infinite ones are regular.
We need a method to figure infinite non-regular languages out: pumping lemma.<br/>

Let L be an infinite regular language.
Then there exists some positive m such that any w âˆˆ L with ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfn_jvn%20%5Csmall%20%7Cw%7C%20%5Cgeq%20m)
can be decomposed as w = xyz with ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfn_jvn%20%5Csmall%20%7Cxy%20%7C%5Cleq%20m)
and ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfn_jvn%20%5Csmall%20%7Cy%20%7C%5Cgeq%201)
such that ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfn_jvn%20%5Csmall%20w_%7Bi%7D%20%3D%20xy%5Eiz) is also in L
for i = 0, 1, 2, ...
While i keeps growing, if there is only one value of i that does not fit to the language definition,
the language is not regular and it is called y cannot be "pumped".
Therefore, we can determine only non-regular languages with pumping lemma, not regular ones.
