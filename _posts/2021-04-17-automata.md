There are three basic keywords to understand automata theory: language, grammar, and automata.<br/>

## Languages and Grammars

There are a lot of languages in the world: I will use English to explain its definition.
1. Alphabet: a finite and nonempty set Î£ of symbols which are a, b, c, and so on
2. String: a finite sequence of symbols
    - Î£*: a set of strings
    - Î£+ = Î£* - Î»
    - Empty: Î» (|Î»| = 0)
    - ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfn_jvn%20%5Csmall%20w%20%3D%20w%5Clambda%20%3D%20%5Clambda%20w)
    - ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfn_jvn%20%5Csmall%20w%5E0) = Î»
3. Operations
    - Concatenation: w = abc, v = xyz â†’ wv = abcxyz (w: prefix, v: suffix)
    - Reverse: w = abc â†’ ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfn_jvn%20%5Csmall%20w%5ER) = cba
    - Length: w = abc â†’ ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfn_jvn%20%5Csmall%20%7Cw%7C) = 3
    - Repeat: ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfn_jvn%20%5Csmall%20w%5E3) = www

Language is a subset of Î£*.
However, this definition is a little bit ambiguous itself so it needs grammars.<br/>

Grammar is a language with production rules. A grammar G is defined as:
```
G = (V, T, S, P)
```
- `V` variables: a finite set of objects
- `T` terminal symbols: a finite set of objects
- `S` start variable: NOT a set
- `P` productions: a finite set of objects

A language generated by grammar G:
```
L(G) = {w âˆˆ T*: S â‡’* w}
```
`S â‡’* w` can be replaced with a sentential form: `S â‡’ w1 â‡’ w2 â‡’ ... â‡’ wn â‡’ w`.

### Example: find a grammar generating L

![L](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfn_jvn%20%5Csmall%20L%20%3D%20%5C%7Ba%5Enb%5En%3A%20n%5Cgeq%200%5C%7D)

G = ({S, A}, {a, b}, S, P)<br/>

Production rules of P:
```
S â†’ aAb | Î»
A â†’ aAb | Î»
```

## Automata 

Automata are abstract logical machines. (singular: automaton)
Every automaton accepts inputs and produces outputs.
Inputs are going through the control unit (CU) to get outputs.
Automata are divided by two parts as a type of behavior or output:
(1) types of behavior are deterministic and non-deterministic and (2) types of output are accepter and transducer.
- Deterministic: a move is uniquely determined
- Non-deterministic: several moves are possible
- Accepter: accept or reject
- Transducer: strings produced by the control unit

There are four major automata: finite-state machines,
pushdown automata,
linear-bounded automata,
and turing machine.
