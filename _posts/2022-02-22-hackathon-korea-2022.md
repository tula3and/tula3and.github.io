There are 10 things I did at this Qiskit Hackathon Korea 2022.

This hackathon was held online with Veertly and ran from February 7th to February 10th.
Official site is here: [https://qiskithackkorea.creatorlink.net/](https://qiskithackkorea.creatorlink.net/).
I joined as an organizer, a speaker, and a mentor so I need preparing for the hackathon.

## Before the hackathon

1. Event promotion page: I built a promotion page with six quantum computing clubs in South Korea.
I designed the whole frame of this page using Webflow and drew hackathon cartoons with my character.
You can check the page here: [qiskit-hackathon-korea.webflow.io](https://qiskit-hackathon-korea.webflow.io/).
2. Youtube #shorts: I made a Youtube shorts video. This is also for the promotion:
[What Can I Do with Quantum Computing?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6SgkwuXRBUA).
There are several projects using Qiskit.
3. Ryoko bot with IBM Watson Assistant: Ryoko bot was appeared once in 2020 with [Quantum Challenge](https://github.com/qiskit-community/IBMQuantumChallenge2020) and
thankfully, she joined this hackathon too for giving challenge hints so I worked as an interpreter for her.
It was my first time to use this service and make a chatbot with IBM Watson Assistant.
4. Networking questions: I collected some ice breaking questions and created a streamlit page to print one of them randomly.
The codes are on my github: [tula3and/random-question-generator](https://github.com/tula3and/random-question-generator).
5. [QiskitBlocks](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/QiskitBlocks) event: Thanks to Dongsin, multiplay servers were ready for networking event.
I made a poster to introduce the event with the image I drew. (I really love the main color of Qiskit!)

## During the hackathon

1. How to contribute to Qiskit: I had a presentation on making real contributions with Github at the first day of the hackathon.
The presentation is on my Youtube channel: [QiskitÏóê Í∏∞Ïó¨ÌïòÍ∏∞ Ïã§Ï†Ñ Ìé∏](https://youtu.be/5cSdM5nBJ60).
2. Project pitch: I want to make QPong online and opened the issue, but it did not work well. (Members were not enough...)
I will try to make it online in this year.
3. Mentors of [quantum-meets-hangul](https://github.com/jhlee29/quantum-meets-hangul): I joined one project as a mentor and it was related to QML.
4. Community Choice Award: The project got the award! Congratulation! üéâ
5. [Kudoboard](https://www.kudoboard.com/): Thank you for the supports from participants, speakers, mentors and organizers!
Many people wrote letters and showed their appreciation through this thank-you-board website.
I wrote several thank-you notes there, but I want to leave one more for Sophy again because this was actually her idea.
I really enjoyed this Kudoboard, wrapping up the end of the hackathon. Thank you!
