November 2021 Review.<br/>
With [Better - BoA](https://youtu.be/O0sA6Dml54I)

## I love extensions in VSC

I have already written the post about this open-source contribution event in my blog:
[오픈소스에 기여해보는 경험이 필요한 이유](https://tula3and.github.io/project/open-source-contribution-academy/#).
It was written in Korean so I will share a little bit more in English here.
This event was held for two days with mentors from Microsoft.
I joined in the Azure SDK team so I can use Azure for the first time in my life.
There is a free USD100 credit for any person who has a student account and
you can check remains of the credit in this link: [www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/Balance](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/Balance).
I also used a SSH extension in VSC first and it was so convenient for remote development: [setting details](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).
I think it is really powerful to set the development environment on Windows with WSL and VSC.
I am planning to make a remote environment on my iPad with Azure after I've finished exams.

## Take IELTS

I think of joining an exchange program so I have taken the IELTS Academic.
Taking IELTS was an unprecedented experience for me.
I chose a paper-base exam thus I should go to the place before 8am.
It was quite hard to wake up this early.
Anyway, the test was not that difficult overall but I am not sure the speaking score.
I did not say well for an unexpected question.
I should make time for speaking English and read more quesiton examples before taking IELTS again. 

## Endless assignments 

I have finished three small projects from classes but there is still one left.
First one is making a calculator with assembly language (w/[rars](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars)) and second
one is completing C codes to understand how a single cycle processor works.
The other is implementing SHA-1 algorithm with Verilog (w/[Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html)).
All the assignments are based on C language so I do not use Python enough in this semester.
In this winter vacation, I should do a toy project using Python. (Let's follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)!)
