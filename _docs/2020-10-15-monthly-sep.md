September 2020 Review.<br/>
With [Bad Words - Tobias Jesso Jr.](https://youtu.be/ck0nthkUdCo)

## Can I ask a question?

>"If you wish to strive for peace of soul and pleasure, then believe; if you wish to be a devotee of truth, then inquire."<br/>- Friedrich Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols

There are a lot of different life values for each person.
Some people might think the best thing is being happy or others might not.
In this sentence, my life value is closer to the latter one.
However, I am not sure what the better one is.
I have just been living with questions that I made.
Actually, I think this way of life is working well in the coding world.
After started coding in 2020, I realized questions are good for making codes.
I should have questions for unknown errors and what parts makes them occured.
That helped me a lot to get out of the hell with errors.
Now, I love my personality (Wait, is it a kind of personalities?) thanks to Python!

## Moving to Github

September 5th, I finally made Github blog! I love the style of Jekyll.
I can slightly understand what uncertainty of the future means.
I cannot expect at all what I am doing now.
If I go back to the past and tell me about future me, maybe she will not believe.
Uncertainty makes the life meaningful.
I cannot wait to meet future me.
What am I really doing next month or next year?ðŸ™„

## Join a lecture about QML

The price is quite expensive but it deserves my money.
What I should do is just learning more than what I paid.
Keep studying hard and be curious about all the things around!
The lecture is in Modulabs: [QML](https://home.modulabs.co.kr/product/13th-tfq-qml/).
