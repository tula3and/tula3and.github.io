August 2021 Review.<br/>
With [Love Me Like That - Sam Kim](https://youtu.be/Nl1-FhTdevQ)

## Qiskit Advocate!!!!!

I got accepted as a member of Qiskit Advocates!!!!!
I am so happy that I am in the community of advocates.
Still any advocate program is not started yet, but I submitted an application of mentorship program
which will announce matched project soon.
I cannot wait joining various advocate programs.
You can see me on the Qiskit Advocate page: [https://qiskit.org/advocates/](https://qiskit.org/advocates/).
Find and meet me in Qiskit Slack!

## Interview as a Qiskit Advocate

I had an interview with [http://www.qcenter.kr/](http://www.qcenter.kr/) as a member of Korean Qiskit Advocates.
New advocates participated in this interview.
The video will be uploaded at Youtube. (Sadly, it is not open yet.)
It is first time for me to do just an interview, not a presentation,
so you maybe notice that I was a little bit nervous infront of my laptop's webcam.
Anyway, I really did enjoy the interview and hope our Qiskit Korean community keeps growing bigger!

## The first covid vaccine

Finally, I got my first covid vaccine, Pfizer.
It was a first shot and there was no side effect, except pain of my left arm.
After six weeks, I got the next shot.
When the day comes, the midterm exam will be getting closer also.
I am worried that I heard that second one can cause a fever with higher probability.
It cannot be worse than the exam season with a fever.
