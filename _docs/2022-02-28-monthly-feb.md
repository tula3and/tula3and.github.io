February 2022 Review.<br/>
With [| playlist | Romantic jazz for lovers](https://youtu.be/TA-mrFKjpLY)

## Hectic days

During the hackathon, I was fully into all programs: [What I did at Qiskit Hackathon Korea 2022](https://tula3and.github.io/hackathon/hackathon-korea-2022/).
I watched live lectures and participated in every networking session.
I also joined as a mentor of the project, Hangul characters classification by QML.
Our team make a Hangul dataset ourselves. Real handwriting!
It was a meaningful time applying QML for an actual project.
At the end of this event, participants wrote thank-you notes while waiting for prize announcement.
I cannot forget this moment until now because I really like sharing experience and appreciation.
If I hold an event someday, I will definitely leave a space for writing these cards. ðŸ’Œ

## My winter vacation

I went a winter vacation to Seosan.
It was just lovely. I can enjoy the snow which is not possible in where I live.
Actually I want to make a short movie for this travel but I forgot to take a video enough.
I was completely relaxed while staying at there.
I am already looking forward to taking a trip in summer...
Truly hope that the covid ends before the summer vacation!

## Level up!

Now I am Alpha of Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors! There are 4 stages in MLSA: New, Alpha, Beta, and Gold.
Each stage has different benefits.
(Details are on Handbook in Program Overview on Microsoft Teams.)
I have gotten Azure monthly credits. I know that there is a chance to buy a personal domain for free.
I should consider what name will be best for me before choosing certain name.
