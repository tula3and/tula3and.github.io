June 2021 Review.<br/>
With [Radio Swiss Classic](https://www.radioswissclassic.ch/en)

## Quantum hackathon

I participated in a hackathon related quantum again.
This hackathon was held in only Korea. I made a quiz app based on Qiskit Textbook.
I have to prepare the Qiskit Advocate test, so I kept reading this textbook website.
While reading, I think it is better there is a small test to check what I understand is right.
Therefore, I decided to make this app for beginners with Qiskit.
All the codes and the page are on Github: [qiskit-textbook-master](https://github.com/tula3and/qiskit-textbook-master).
Actually, there is only one quiz opened now.
Making a quiz set is quite hard to me.
I will update it when my ideas of quiz are ready to upload.

## The semester is finally over!

There were the least classes in this semester (among three semesters in my college),
but I was the most exhausted. Nevertheless, I got quite high score.

After I checked my report card, I was so relieved.
Now I am in summer vacation and it is raining outside.
In Korea, the rainy season has started today.
I am writing this with sounds of rain and classic. I am satisfied.

## MacBook Pro VS.

I found a labtop which is exactly same with MacBook Pro, except the price, the weight, and the OS.
The laptop is ThinkPad T14 Gen2.
Its price is twice lower and also lighter than macbook.
However, the main point is the OS.
I have used only Windows so it is a nice experience using mac OS.
The biggest problem is the price.
I can afford both of them, but I am not sure that I can utilize MacBook Pro well compared to its price.
Maybe I will keep considering until the next semester starts. :(
