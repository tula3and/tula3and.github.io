November 2020 Review.<br/>
With [I Know You Can Dance - Chris James](https://youtu.be/yuE1nnYkCIA)

## Qadjoke bot is here again!

Finally, our october's project is [in Full-Stack Quantum Computation](https://fullstackquantumcomputation.tech/blog/post-quantum-ugly-duckling/)!
I am so happy that the post is on.
(And I am in [the Qontributors list](https://fullstackquantumcomputation.tech/contributing/#qontributors)!)
It took quite a long time for improving the words to make people understand easily.
Appreciate for curators' work.
I cannot forget this experience.
Plus, I participated in [IBM Quantum Challenge - Fall 2020](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/a9904e72-22b7-43e2-84ef-95679d73f430/twitter).
Keeping eyes on these challenges can be a good choice studying Qiskit.

## My first hacking tool

I have used a hacking tool for the first time of my life.
I used the tool named Burpsuite for taking a packet capture.
I explained what I did here: [OCOL Medium](https://medium.com/ocol/%ED%8C%A8%ED%82%B7-%EA%B0%80%EB%A1%9C%EC%B1%84%EA%B8%B0-2b8878b647ae).
I should try other tools, also.
The time to find what's next.<br/>

Question: are these things helpful for CTF?
I made [a repository for picoCTF](https://github.com/tula3and/picoCTF) for saving write-up.
I will go further to this security parts using winter vacation.
(Several things to study: (1) [Resources for beginner bug bounty hunters](https://github.com/nahamsec/Resources-for-Beginner-Bug-Bounty-Hunters)
(2) [MIT lectures: computer systems security](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-858-computer-systems-security-fall-2014/video-lectures/))
When the next semester begins, I expect this repository is full with my writings.

## Working on two toy projects

I was working on two small projects for joining hackathons on KNU.

- [For KNU newbies](https://github.com/tula3and/for-knu-newbies)
- [What to eat](https://github.com/tula3and/rainbow-meal)

Both projects are using Expo webview to make applications for Android.
While working on them, I should make something unique next year for getting better results.
Will learn new things before next hackathons!
