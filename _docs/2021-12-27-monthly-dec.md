December 2021 Review.<br/>

## QAMP final showcase

There was a final showcase for QAMP!
It was so meaningful for me while doing such a long project.
I bet this is the longest project which I partcipated in.
Most of my projects are related to hackathons so they were short-term projects: took at most 2 months.
My presentation file is on the issue: [qamp-fall-21](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-fall-21/issues/16#issuecomment-989615745).
I also requested my presentation video clip.
I will share the video link here after I get that.

## Come close to going CES 2022

Sadly, it failed because of the variant of COVID-19.
I was planned to go Las Vegas to see CES 2022 in real, not virtual, but
the situation were getting worse and my university has canceled all the plans, eventually.
When will this virus end? I want to take off these masks and travel abroad, just like before the pandemic.

## Recap of my 2021

There are 5 days left this year so I prepared a short recap for me!

![goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62553200/147449717-d8c9bd6f-0fa0-445a-b351-18061b6f4d3c.jpg)

These 10 goals are written at the beginning of this year and
I wrapped up this todo list as a kind of present for the end of 2021.
As you can see, I have achieved 3 out of 10: not that good score.
In the right below, I wrote these 10 thing in English with a little bit of personal details.

- [x] Qiskit Advocate: you can find me on this page: [Qiskit Advocates](https://qiskit.org/advocates/).
- [x] IELTS 6.5 band score: I got 6.5, perfect fit. (A part of my report is just below.)

- [ ] JLPT N2: did not apply it because the test date did not match for my schedule.
- [ ] English - Advanced and Japanese - Intermediate: it means the language section of my profile in LinkedIn. I want to upgrade my language skill
but I need to practice more before I update it.
- [x] Over 4/4.3 GPA: based on now.
- [ ] 1 book per month: I guess I read over 12 books this year but I do not have any record that I read it per month.
I should write notes somewhere in 2022!
- [ ] Use Kaggle at least once
- [ ] Play Ring Fit Adventure 3 times a week: let's do exercise regularly in 2022.
- [ ] Did you read all of Dreamhack lectures?
- [ ] Solved Platinum: I am [Silver I](https://solved.ac/profile/tula3and) now.

Reviewing my result, I realized it is better to see goals more often.
I did hide the list too well to have done all these things in this year.
For 2022, I will check my goal list frequently and get 10 out of 10!

12월 리뷰도 끝냈으니 이제 내년을 위한 만다라트를 또 쓰러가야겠다.
이번 만다라트는 목표한 것을 보다 많이 이룰 수 있도록 더 많은 시간을 가지고 오랫동안 써보려고 한다.
이 글을 쓰면서 올해에는 뭘 했는지를 살펴봤는데, 전체적으로 무난한 한 해였다는 생각이 든다.
잔잔했던 2021년을 발판 삼아서 2022년에는 더 많이 성취하기를!
