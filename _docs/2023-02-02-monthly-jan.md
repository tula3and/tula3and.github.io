January 2022 Review.<br/>
With [èŠ±äººå±€ / æ˜¥æ³¥æ£’ - ãƒ¨ãƒ«ã‚·ã‚«](https://youtu.be/Ht6lcYg9Zfo)

## Official tutorial written by me

I wrote two tutorials with Vishal and Ikko at the end of my internship and
one of them is finally merged: [PR #669 in Qiskit Runtime](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/pull/669).
As a member of Qiskit Advocates, the tutorial website is familiar to me
because it is a good reference for writing Qiskit codes.
It is first time to directly contribute to the official tutorial even though
I've participated as a Korean translator.
You can see the deployed one here:
[Noisy Simulators in Qiskit Runtime](https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/how_to/noisy_simulators.html).
I can't wait to translate this one too!

## Let's make a pottery!

After I came back to Korea, I've started to attend a pottery class with my sister.
Actually I am not a fan of creating something real by using my hands so I was immersed on painting only in the past.
Especially watercolor!
However, unlike me, my sister likes creating compared to painting.
My decision going to the class may have been influenced by her, but thanks to her, I noticed creating is also entertaining.
It is lovely that I can say one more thing while talking about my hobby.

## Endless game

I wrote a review for my 5-month internship in my blog post:
[3 Things I Learned During My First Internship](https://tula3and.github.io/experience/3-things-I-learned-in-my-first-internship/#).
I mentioned that I will take JLPT in 2023 so recently I study Kanji every morning.
I know some Chinese characters because many Korean words are made up of them.
However, Kanji is more difficult that one character has many ways to read.
It means I should remember all of the methods for each character!
Once I set my goal of memorizing 2,136 characters before the start of the spring semester...
Well, we'll see. ðŸ˜…
