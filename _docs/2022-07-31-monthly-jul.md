July 2022 Review.<br/>

## My first internship

I am going to work as an intern in IBM Japan from tomorrow.
Actually, I arrived in Japan a few days ago and I still cannot believe it.
It is my first time to join as a side of a company
so I am looking forward to learning something new and contributing to the company with a fresh perspective,
which means... I will do my best during the internship!

## Being a part of quantum community

I participated in IBM Quantum's satellite session at [Nano Korea 2022](https://ace.postech.ac.kr/event/nano-korea-2022).
My topic was related to building a quantum community so I introduced
some Korean quantum communities including `#korean` channel in Qiskit Slack.
I also talked about Qiskit Advocates: what they are, what benefits they have, and how they can be.
It was based on my real experience.
I've joined a lot of meaningful events after being Qiskit Advocate from August 2021.
From the events, I could meet amazing people and I think it is the best thing of joining quantum community which I wanted to share!
The presentation file (in Korean) is on my slideshare:

## Summer in Tokyo

I've heard that summer days in Tokyo is extremely tough and now I can understand what it means truly.
My hometown is also quite famous because of its hot summer days but I think Tokyo is much hotter.
Its weather is not just hot. It is obviously, also humid.
I just gave up walking around in the middle of the day here. üî•
