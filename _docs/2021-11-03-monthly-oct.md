October 2021 Review.<br/>
With [タイミング - 大橋トリオ -ohashiTrio-](https://youtu.be/e44MHoVFSvU)

## Autumn is coming

Finally autumn is coming!
Although I really love to see the scenery in full of green, I was tired of the heat of summer.
These days, there is a sequence of perfect days with blue sky
and this season is for IBM Quantum Challenge!

## Quantum Challenge

There were two live session before this challenge.
I have written a post after watching the first session: [Qiskit 최적화와 머신 러닝 맛보기](https://tula3and.github.io/qiskit/qiskit-optimization-machine-learning-kor/).
I wrote this in Korean for Korean participants in the challenge.
Even more, this challenge is special that there is Korean notebook for the first time in IBM Quantum Challenge!
Thanks to Soyoung and Jeongwon, I can enjoy the whole questions with Korean!
It feels much easiler than before because all the explainations are in Korean.
I completed all on my own!

## Mid-term exams

The last week of October was full of exams.
Now all the tests have finished and it is time to focus on the `cloud-ready` project.
This October was just nothing special because of the exams. + I will take the IELTS test soon.
There are four sections to prepare: writing, reading, listening, and speaking.
Study hard for high scores!
