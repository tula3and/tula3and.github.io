September 2022 Review.<br/>
With [dna - LANY](https://youtu.be/EDOzUWDAeQA)


## QPong 2.0

I am participating in the QAMP again!
The reason why I decided to join it is that one of the projects is interesting: [QPong 2.0](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-fall-22/issues/26)
from Junye.
I personally tried to convert this as an online game but it didn't go well.
However, I found that there is a QPong project and thought it will be a great chance to make it real.
Our team had three meetings until now. Among them,
the second meeting was the most unforgettable. At that moment, we had a brainstorming session
using a tool called [Miro](https://miro.com/).
I do enjoy talking people who have a similiar interest with me and in our QPong team,
everyone loves games! Because of this, all the ideas from this session were lovely.
I was truly pleased while talking about my ideas and listening to others' ones.
There is a first checkpoint next Thursday and I will give a presentation with one of our teammates, Unathi.
Looking forward to listening other teams' project!

## Thanks to mentoring

From August 2022, I am working as an IBM Quantum intern in Japan and
also having a weeking meeting with Kifumi.
I undoubtedly anticipate the meeting because I can ask questions face to face.
I prefer to have a discussion with people while defining or solving any problem.
That's why I like meeting with her. または、きふみさんと話せるのがただ好きだからかも。
いつも質問に親切に答えてくれて、ほんとにありがとうございます！
Additionally, I want to mention one more mentoring with Junye.
As a part of the QAMP, there is a meeting with a mentor and as I mentioned above, the mentor of our project is Junye!
Thankfully, he made a 1:1 meeting to each our team member and I had a first 1:1 with him last week.
It was a meaningful time to get to know him better. I could get advice related to my future career path as well.
我的导师，谢谢!

## Getting close to Japan

It has been more than two months since I came to Japan.
I am getting used to cooking three meals a day for me.
時々面倒ですが、まあ、うまくいけば気分がいいです。
週末にはどこか出ていくのにいつも木が多くて気持ちいいです。
韓国に戻るとこんな風景がとても懐かしいと思います。
