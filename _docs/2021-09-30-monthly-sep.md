September 2021 Review.<br/>
With [Run It - DJ Snake, Rick Ross, Rich Brian](https://youtu.be/AVqJou2ngpM)

## My first Go project

I have done my first Go project at the beginning of this month: [me-sign](https://github.com/tula3and/me-sign).
MeSign is based on blockchain and I referenced the implementation from the lectures, [Nomad Coin](https://nomadcoders.co/nomadcoin).
Actually, this project is for a competition in South Korea and, sadly, I could not pass the qualifying round. (I am not sure this is a proper word.)
I was a little bit down once, but in a way, I thought it was a great experience to use various modules in Go and also study blockchain.

## Join the QAMP

I joined the first advocate activity, QAMP.
Among awesome projects, I could be a member of [cloud-ready](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-fall-21/issues/16).
I like the point of this project, migration to the cloud.
I kept doing several projects using static webpages but I did not use the cloud environment that much.
I thought it would be a nice chance to adapt my skills in actual situation and also this is my first time
to participate in a real long-term project. Quite nervous.
I just hope that I can do my part well.

## Sharing my knowledge

From this month, I start to share my knowledge to my friends.
I open two study groups every week: (1) Python and (2) drawing.
First, I teach the basics of Python.
My til repository is really helpful to remember what I studied in the first step of Python.
Second, I teach how to draw with an iPad.
This is not directly related to my major but I have had personal interests using drawing tools.
It will be a nice way to verify whether my skills is helpful.
Last week, my friend who takes my drawing class said my skills do work well for her and
I was genuinely happy when I had just heard that sentence.
I bet teaching others is an amazing stuff for me, not only them.
While teaching both, I could notice missing parts and improve my oral presentation.
(Plus, I cannot deny I had a pleasant time. XD)
