April 2021 Review.<br/>
With [x (Deluxe Edition) by Ed Sheeran](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mLBzyKhbG9yNsTXVMj0ruCwusJhUcc4JA)

## Midterm exams are over!

It was not that tough but I had to wake up earlier than usual.
That makes me tired enough.
I want the summer vacation right now. u.u

## Selection

I had finished one of my activities, a participation of the class in modulabs.
Now I have more time to focus other things: prepare for the Qiskit Advocate application and [apply to CDL Quantum](https://www.creativedestructionlab.com/quantum-application/).
(For 2021's Qiskit Advocates, the application will open in June.)
I do my best to get in both of them.

## Bug bounty hunting?

If time allows, I will take a step in the bug bounty world in the summer vacation.
The main inspiration was an article in rob blog: [Breaking GitHub Private Pages for $35k](https://robertchen.cc/blog/2021/04/03/github-pages-xss).
I am not sure hunting goes well, but I think it can be a good try for using what I learned.
