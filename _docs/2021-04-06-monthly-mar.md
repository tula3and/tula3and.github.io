## Virtual career connection day with MS

I participated in [Virtual Career Connection Day](https://www.wiset.or.kr/contents/information_view.jsp?sc_tab=1&sc_type=1&sc_page=1&pk_seq=34285&sc_cond=1&page=1).
I could hear about growth mindset and microsoft internship journey: you can check internship opportunities at
[here](https://careers.microsoft.com/students/us/en/us-ur-intern-results).
There is also a learning material from Microsoft which is called [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/ko-kr/learn/).
This will be a good starting point to study Azure services.
After this welcoming session, I had a mentoring with Soyeon Kim who is HR senior manager at Microsoft Korea.
She told me that there are four key elements: culture & leadership, competency, track record, and knowledge.
(Culture contains growth mindset, which is mentioned before.)
In these elements, competency is from participants' record.
It means that the main point is what competence you do get while building their record.
It was a quite short time but I could take a peek at microsoft culture and sights.
Thanks to mentors and staffs for orgainzing this meaningful event!

## Basics of quantum cryptography

I presented quantum cryptography at modulabs.
Cryptography is one of my interests so it is glorious while preparing this presentation.
From this knowledge, I will connect it with real codes, QKD.
Therefore, my next plan is to make a keynote with QKD codes.
*Details of quantum crytography that I wrote is here: https://tula3and.github.io/cryptography/quantum-cryptography/#

## Writeups

I joined a web hacking study in my club: [KERT](https://github.com/KERT-core).
At a part of activities, I kept writing writeups for web hacking problems that I solved.
(The solutions are locked because of the policy in each wargame site.)
It is quite hard to solve problems steadily, but I am learning a lot from this activity.
My writeups are on this site: [TULA Writeup](https://tula3and.tistory.com/)
