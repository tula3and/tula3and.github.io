## Qiskit Hackathon Korea

Qiskit Hackathon Korea will be starting on February 16 at 10:00 KST:
[medium](https://medium.com/qiskit/feel-the-rhythm-of-quantum-with-our-qiskit-hackathon-korea-e80c27fdb9f9).
I participated in this hackathon as one of Qiskit student supporters and also a participant!
As a volunteer, I made [a notion page](https://www.notion.so/Qiskit-Hackathon-Korea-3ce94ce5c3ad450e852af7953e7a62a6) for the hackathon promotion:
a collection of former hackathon reviews and Qiskit tutorials.
This work would be helpful for begineers of quantum computing with Qiskit.
I cannot wait this event. It will be really fun!

## Python challenge

I worked on python challenge: [write-up](https://github.com/tula3and/til/tree/master/Python/Python%20Challenge).
There are currently 33 levels but I stopped at 17.
The stages got harder and harder when I leveled up.
(17 was a limit at that time.)
However, I could learn more about python modules while solving each level.
(Especially dealing with images!)
Some problems are similar with CTF ones, so you can solve easily if you are used to those things.
In addition, they are basically riddles.
You have a passion for them (and know some python codes), then it will be the best choice for you.
So do I. I love riddles. I really like the solving moments.
Therefore, I will do this challenge when I am craving for this kind of questions.

## Leave my art works

Loving something is not a big deal.
If you consider or think it a little more, that's it.
For me, it was hard to admit that drawing is my hobby.
I am not that good at drawing to say that is my favorite thing.
However, ability is not important to select what I want to do.
After I realized that, I think my past drawings which were not my belongings.
Because of this, I started [Behance](https://www.behance.net/tula3and/) for saving my drawings.
Plus, my design works.
