December 2020 Review.<br/>
With [Alone - Heart](https://youtu.be/1Cw1ng75KP0)

## Let's quantum

I participated in Women Who Code Seoul year-end event as a speaker: [live streaming video](https://youtu.be/8W0j0tgEGMk).
My topic is how I could get to quantum computing: [presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/DayeongKang/lets-quantum).
I just started my journey with coding this year and hoped this presentation helps newbies feel easy about coding.
While looking back this year, I can know this world from a mentor that I met from a external activity,
so I thought networking is really important to newbies.
(Especially emphasized this part.)
Actually, this is the first presentation uploaded on YouTube.
I just wish that just one person had help.
Anyway, it was a great experience!
Thank you for all listeners and staffs.

## One more video

This is the second video on YouTube: [IBM Quantum Challenge 2020: Programming for the not-so-distant quantum future](https://youtu.be/fD9ghE3eRio).
Just the part I spoke Korean is added there.
My [t-shirt from Quantum Universal Education](https://twitter.com/tula3and/status/1341962033013506049?s=20) is arrived also!
The design is so cool!!!!! It was arrived at Christmas Eve, so I felt like this one is from Santa.
(Of course not XD)

## Special year, wasn't it?

2020 is a really special year that I ever had.
(It was actually special for everyone, not just me.)
I think that I did my best just in my position.
2021 will make me better.
To invest all my potentials, I literally get a rest for myself.<br/>

코로나 때문에 분명 힘든 한해였지만, 잘 버티고 발전해 온 내 자신을 충분히 격려하고 싶다.
물론 그러기 위해서 12월 통째로 휴가를 스스로 줬지만 말이다.
12월 휴가 때문에 미뤄둔 일을 이제 내일부터는 하나씩 다시 시작해보자.
2020년처럼 후회하지 않을 2021년을 만들기 위해. 최선을 다해서 다시 달려보자!!!!!
(Github 잔디도 다시 채우고 말이다.)
