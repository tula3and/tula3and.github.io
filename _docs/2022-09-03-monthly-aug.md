August 2022 Review.<br/>
With [Make It Up As We Go - Dira](https://youtu.be/PO64hVIp5Yk)

## First day of my internship

From the first day of my internship, I went a business travel to Kawasaki city.
I wrote a blog post about the event: [Kawasaki Quantum Summer Camp](https://tula3and.github.io/experience/kawasaki-camp/).
As I mentioned in the post, there was a recap meeting at the end of every day and it was great to receive feedbacks and
share them among staffs for tomorrow.
Recently, there was the recap meeting again for reviewing this camp.
I was quite surprised that most of staffs were there even though it's been a while after the event.
Including this meeting, I've learned a lot and had unforgettable memories related to this travel.
Really appreciated to Yuri, Kifumi, and Sophy!

## Meet at the internship cafe

At the last day of this month, there was an on-site event for interns in IBM Japan Research.
It was valuable experience hearing other interns' background and research interests.
This is my first time going to the internship cafe so I received welcome goods; a bee badge, a vinyl bag, and a pair of socks.

On that day, I also made my ID card.
If you see it in the above image, my face looks blank.
Actually I had an intention to have a smile at that moment but I missed the timing. :joy:

## Reading is lovely

I read books every day after my work so the majority of reading time is after the dinner and
I think it is the best time to read books.
The reason is that I can listen to crickets' sound as a background music.
It is such a perfect option that I could choose.
My favorite book of this August is 'The Midnight Library' by Matt Haig.
I am not a fan of this kind of novels but I undoubtedly enjoyed it.
Highly recommended!
