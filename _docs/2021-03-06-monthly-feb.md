February 2021 Review.<br/>
With [I Don't Like Mondays](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBN5Rb1Xc0Kcvfy_82hY08f1CUjUN_aQq)

## Second Qiskit hackathon

I participated in the Qiskit hackathon, again.
In this time, it was held in Korea.
Our project title is Qoupang: Quantum Blockchain Solution for Logistics.
I worked as a project manager on this project.
Details of my work is here: [Blockchain with Qiskit: Qoupang](https://tula3and.github.io/hackathon/hackathon-blockchain/).
I was not just a participant but also a volunteer of this hackathon.
As a volunteer, I made [a promotion page](https://tula3and.github.io/qiskit-hackathon-korea-promotion/)
to get attention of Korean students who are not familiar with quantum computing.
I think the promotion worked well because more than 150 people got involved in this event!
It was really meaningful moment and thankfully, our project got the Community Choice Award.
I cannot wait Qiskit goods for this award!
(I heard that they are Qiskit hoodie and stickers.)

## The end

One of my project, OCOL, was finished.
I kept writing articles and newletters from August 2020.
In December, our team decided to rest for reorganization of our newsletter service.
While thinking about our service, I could not find what is the best to promote our service.
I was also not sure that this work would be helpful to subscribers.
Because of these reasons, it was good timing to stop OCOL.
I should be a specialist first in what I want to write about before I start this kind of service again.

## Sophomore

I am sophomore now!
The winter vacation is over.
Why is every vacation too short?
I am already waiting next vacation.
(I just need time to focus on toy projects...)
