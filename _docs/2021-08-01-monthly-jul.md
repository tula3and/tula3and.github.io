July 2021 Review.<br/>
With [유희열 소품집 `여름날`](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nRYK5A1JvQWhiACp4XBXkTPRsD6F7V-sc)

## Took a test for the application

I took a test for the application of Qiskit advocate!
This provides only an offline test so I went to Daejeon.
I could get [this badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/96f7f8f3-6fb1-4020-bc2b-5b449eca96ae) after passing the exam.
The exam was proceeded with the given computer, not the paper.
Questions are quite tricky if you have not used Qiskit modules enough,
so I think it is important to check functions in each module well.
Now, I just wait for the announcement from Qiskit official.

## My projects with Qiskit

I presented [`My Projects with Qiskit`](https://www.slideshare.net/DayeongKang/my-projects-with-qiskit)
in the first anniversary of Full-Stack Quantum Computation: https://fullstackquantumcomputation.tech/anniversary/.
While preparing, I could organize my projects related Qiskit once again and
also review my quantum journey with Qiskit started from October 2020.
My quantum one-year anniversary is also getting closer!

## Summer vacation

Because of the pendemic, I cannot go abroad for the summer vacation but I found this place.

It is in the middle of the mountain at Chuncheon.
I spent the time with my best friend and it was JUST PERFECT!
