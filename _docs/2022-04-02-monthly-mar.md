March 2022 Review.<br/>
With [Rum Pum Pum - Lee Jin Ah](https://youtu.be/6UKti_5CG_E)

## New semester

This is my third year at KNU.
It feels a kind of weird that I've already passed the half.
The time flies so fast because of the covid.
For this semester, I am taking 6 classes:

- Algorithm
- Japanese Popular Culture
- French
- Operating System
- Probability and Statistics
- Network Programming

I always have in mind to learn French so I am excited to take this French class,
even though it is in the early morning. Someday I will definitely take the DELF exam!
*If you are also a French beginner, I highly recommend this video from Youtube: [Œuf vs. Œufs](https://youtube.com/shorts/qYfY51FK7XM?feature=share).
He is hilarious!

## Have you ever used Azure Quantum before?

I am preparing a presentation to share easy steps using Azure Quantum.
Actually there is good documentation to start Azure Quantum.
Especially, this learning path in Microsoft Learn,
[Quantum computing foundations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/quantum-computing-fundamentals/), is
super cool to take a first step of quantum computing, not just for Azure Quantum.
(It also supports quite proper Korean translation!)
Based on this material, I will write posts in my blog and make the presentation.

## First interview

I took a job interview and it was the first time!
I thought that my speech speed was a little bit fast during the interview.
I should practice to slow down the speed for delivering what I want to say exactly.
Currently, I am waiting for the next step announcement.
I hope everything goes well!
