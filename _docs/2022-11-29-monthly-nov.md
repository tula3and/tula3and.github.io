November 2022 Review.<br/>
With [Stay - NELL](https://youtu.be/bmivgWKzGkM)


## The end of the challenge

The main project of my internship is almost finished
while the last month in IBM is coming.
For this IBM Quantum Challenge (IQC) Fall, I‚Äôve prepared three labs from August.
Among these labs, I‚Äôve chiefly focused on lab 1 and finalized 6 exercises in it.
If you want to check the notebook, you can see the entire one at Github:
[qiskit-community/ibm-quantum-challenge-fall-22/lab1](https://github.com/qiskit-community/ibm-quantum-challenge-fall-22/blob/main/content/lab-1/lab1.ipynb).
During this challenge, there was a session for Korean Qiskit community and
I presented lab 3 with a few additional resources. I attached one of the slides below.

I personally thought that this challenge went so well and smoothly
thanks to our IQC team members and amazing mentors! Thank you so much to all!

## Second checkpoint

There was second checkpoint for the QAMP: [QPong 2.0 #26](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-fall-22/issues/26#issuecomment-1302034632).
For the second checkpoint, I and Unathi took a look to figure out how to share data as a multiplayer game in PICO-8,
so we referred these two repositories.

- [github.com/joshiemoore/p8modem](https://github.com/joshiemoore/p8modem)
- [github.com/JRJurman/pico-pong-online](https://github.com/JRJurman/pico-pong-online)

While reading them, it was very helpful to understand the structure between `.p8` and `.js`.
Now it is time to create a real multiplay game for QPong!

## My short vacation to Hakone

I went a vacation to Hakone with my mom.
It was my first time to go to Hakone and I really satisfied every moment at there.
Especially, the hot springs were perfect for taking a rest. The scenery was also great.

Because it is November, autumn leaves are all around the mountain. üçÅ
If it is possible, I thought I may go to there every year!
