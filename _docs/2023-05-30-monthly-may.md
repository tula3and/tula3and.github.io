May 2023 Review.<br/>

## IBM Quantum Challenge Spring 2023

I participated in the IBM Quantum Challenge Spring 2023 as a mentor.
I am not really actively handle the live questions but I took [a session](https://youtu.be/LwcT8XxW3lg) for Korean participants.
I explained quantum teleportation for lab 2. Even though most exercises in this lab are quite similar with the chapter of Qiskit Textbook,
there is one small difference: Using `if_else` gates.
Every lab let participants use this specific gate because the main focus of this challenge was introducing dynamic circuits
(and 127 qubits!).
Now the challenge is ended but if you want to check out the labs, you may visit this github repository:

## 3 days of exploring the pathways for cloud careers

In early May,
I actively participated in a three-day cloud career session hosted by AWS.
Each session lasted for two hours in the evening, allowing me to conveniently join after my university classes.
What stood out to me was the structure of the sessions, consisting of two segments each day, with a substantial amount of time dedicated to Q&A.
Despite being an online event, there was a remarkable level of engagement from participants,
with numerous questions being raised.
This enthusiastic participation surprised me, highlighting the demand for such sessions among students aspiring to pursue cloud-related careers, including myself.
I was unsure about the specific tasks and responsibilities associated with cloud-related roles.
However, during these three days, I gained valuable insights into the daily workings of cloud experts and witnessed how businesses leverage cloud technologies.
Thank you for all the mentors who made this amazing event happen!

## Leadership in Cisco

One day, in my university's department building,
I noticed a leaflet titled "One-hour for Me" affixed to the one side of the elevator.
The leaflet showcased various sessions conducted by mentors from different IT industries.
Among the session titles, one in particular caught my attention: "Leadership in Cisco & Global Company." by Michelle Jeong.
Instantly intrigued, I wrote the application form and eagerly awaited the scheduled date for this session. During the one-hour session,
I had the opportunity to hear the company culture of Cisco and gain insights into the significance of user experience analysis.
Furthermore, I received valuable tips on contributing to effective meetings in a global company setting and making meaningful networking connections.
Listening to her experience resonated with me, drawing parallels to my own experience working in IBM Japan as an intern in the previous year.
I am truly grateful to her delivering this impactful session for students! + One fun fact: Cisco derives its name from the city of San Fran'cisco'.
I didn't know that before this session. üòÜ
