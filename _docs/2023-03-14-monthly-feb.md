February 2023 Review.<br/>
With [O Sole Mio - Jack Jezzro](https://youtu.be/9UxE1DHUBwk)

## Answer questions in a live session

Recently, I had the opportunity to join a Q&A session as a part of MLSA.
This session was all about the MLSA program and open to anyone who is interested in learning more about what it exactly is,
promoting this program for a bigger community.
The format of the session was simple; participants could ask questions during [the live event (Korean)](https://www.youtube.com/live/i9eTs922Xmk?feature=share) in Youtube.
While answering questions during almost an hour,
it allowed me to improve my communication skills and helped to articulate my thoughts and opinions more effectively.
I also can have a time to promote my blog. Thank you for the person who asked me the link! 

## Starting as a TA in new semester

I am excited to announce that I have begun working as a teaching assistant (TA) in the new semester.
This is a great opportunity for me to further develop my skills and gain valuable experience in the field of education.
As a TA, I am responsible for assisting the professor in grading assignments and providing academic support to students.
I am looking forward to working closely with the students and helping them achieve their academic goals.
I believe that this experience will also help me develop my own teaching skills.
In addition, I have a lot of experience as a mentor in Qiskit events so I am confident handling unexpected issues of Python.
(This class is mostly using Python!)
The only part I should be prepared is that explaining data structures and algorithms.
I am a little nervous because it is my first to be a TA, but thrilled at the same time!

## Swimming in Malta

I always hope to swim well enough so that I can dive into the water whenever I want.
Especially, after I read an essay related to swimming in Malta, I decided to attend a swimming class.
However, I could not register it until recently because, as you know, we have to quarantine for COVID-19 from early 2020.
Right after returning from Japan, I searched swimming classes nearby my house and found that one is opened!
From March 2nd, I keep learning how to swim and it is really well-pleasing.
Swimming is a fun and exciting activity that not only provides a refreshing break from routine
but also contributes to overall fitness and well-being.
I am currently in an elementary class and will do my best to move to the next level within 3 months!
