June 2022 Review.<br/>
With [Zephyr Quartet: Golden Brown - The Stanglers](https://youtu.be/Ue1OMKOY8As)

## Ready to go

Finally I've got a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) for applying a Japan Visa.
Thanks to Yuri and Sophy, I could get the Visa.
I really appreciate to their supports. Thanks again. 💜
From August 1st, I could call myself an IBMer.
I cannot wait to join my first internship in IBM Japan!

## Quantum Hackathon Korea 2022

I participated in [Quantum Hackathon Korea 2022](https://www.instagram.com/p/CfY_VDlr4mk/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) as a mentor.
It was my first time to join an offline hackathon, so in every moment, it was quite new to me.
Especially, I am happy that I could meet participants and other Qiskit Advocates in person!
Because of several online Qiskit events, I definitely know them but I never met them in person before.
It was an interesting experience to meet people that I met online first.
I tried to hide my surprise but I don't know it works well or not. 😏
For the mentoring, it was difficult to response unexpected questions fastly.
Maybe it will be nice to make a FAQ website first next time.
At the end of the hackathon, there was a winner announcement and a team I mentored was on the list!
I was delighted. Hooray! 🥳

## Final exam

There is always a final exam season before every the semester ends.
I am quite worried about my score because I do not assign enough time to study
for preparing and checking documents of applying the COE.
However, the result was much better than my expectation! 😌 `*relieved*`
