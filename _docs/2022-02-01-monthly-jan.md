January 2022 Review.<br/>
With [EASY - LUCKY TAPES](https://youtu.be/DY0_U6tYFhk)

## Second Qiskit Hackathon Korea

I joined second Qiskit Hackathon Korea as an organizer and a mentor,
so I have prepared this event for a month.
I made a promotion page again, but at this time, with Webflow: [qiskit-hackathon-korea.webflow.io/](https://qiskit-hackathon-korea.webflow.io/).
This service is really convenient to make a well-made webpage within a short time and
supports to check if the website seems good on different screen demensions.
This feature is helpful to build an interactive page.
I also created a video to publicize this hackathon:
[What Can I Do with Quantum Computing? #shorts](https://youtube.com/shorts/6SgkwuXRBUA?feature=share).
I love the #shorts style.
Meanwhile, I will do a presentation in the first day of hackathon.
The topic is "How to Contribute to Qiskit" and it will be directly related to using Github for contributions.
I keep improving the materials for a better presentation, just for now. Hope this helps hackathon participants!

## I can use Docker!

I have started to learn how to use Docker.
I wrote two posts about Docker in January.
Before the new semester starts, I am going to build a project with Docker.
I also have followed log4j patches and triggered one of its vulnerabilities.
(Details are on [this post](https://tula3and.github.io/security/security-log4j/#).)
While building the vulnerable environment, there was a Dockerfile and the whole process was quick!
I do not know Docker is this amazing.
In my further projects, you may see Dockerfile often. ðŸ˜‹

## New community

Now I am a part of Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors: [Dayeong Kang](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/en-US/profile/183552).
I am still figuring out what I should do in this community...
I will do more things after the hackathon ends.
I have heard this student ambassador program at the open-source contribution event in November 2021.
Through the program, I want to share my experience more and produce many interesting projects with Azure!
