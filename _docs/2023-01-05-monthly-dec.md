December 2022 Review.<br/>
With [YAMAZAKURA - Taeko Onuki](https://youtu.be/iZGleXXX1pI)

## My first Japanese article!

I wrote a Japanese article for the [Advent Calendar](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2022/quantum) from Qiita.
In this calendar page, you can find my character and the blog link in the right below!
It is my first time to write a public post in Japanese so
I thought it is great to choose the most familiar topic for it.
And the result is... Qiskit Runtime!
I mainly focused on the lab 1 notebook in the challenge and it is all about Primitives of Qiskit Runtime.
However, my Japanese writing skill is not that good even though I can speak Japanese.
Thanks to Kifumi and Yuri, my ariticle was changed much better. Thank you so much!

## 3 things I learned during my internship

I shared a presentation, [3 things I learned during my internship](https://www.slideshare.net/DayeongKang/3-things-i-learned-during-my-first-internship-lifeatibm),
at the Qiskit Korean Community meeting.
December is the last month I work as an intern at Japan so
I fisrt reviewed what I did from August and prepared the presentation based on my internship experience.
I wrote a short summary in the following because the presentation file is written in Korean.

Through this internship, I learned a lot of things that I cannot acquire in the university.
Among them, I picked 3 things and shared with the audience.

1. Explore the quantum computing world while preparing the IBM Quantum Challenge Fall
2. Improve communication skills of English and Japanese
3. Grab a lot of opportunities for meaningful networking

The main goal of this internship is for preparing the IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2022
so I can study the quantum computing field deeply while getting to know features of Qiskit Runtime.
In addition, I participated local events which improved my communication skills and provided networking opportunities.
The internship period is 5 months and I thought it is not that long term.
However, I achieved more than I expected and had a lot of good experiences in Tokyo.
I really appreciate to everyone who made this internship happen!

## The end of my internship

The internship was ended and now I am back to Korea.
From the beginning of the internship, there were a lot of things that happened for the first time in my life:
Traveling by myself, working as an intern, and living alone abroad.
I can feel not only what I've achieved as a career (which is described in the above)
but also my personal growth while solving issues which were something completely new in life.
As new year begins, it is time to seriously think about what my next step will be based on my growth in 2022.
Happy new year!
